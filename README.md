# Optical Communication Systems Simulation

Python simulations focused on signal processing and noise analysis within optical networks.

## Core Features:
* **Noise Modeling:** Simulating **Gaussian Noise** environments and their impact on signal integrity.
* **OSNR Analysis:** Calculating Optical Signal-to-Noise Ratio (OSNR) and evaluating system performance.
* **Probabilistic Modeling:** Using **Markov Chain** processes to model state transitions in communication channels.
* **Decision Optimization:** Implementing and visualizing **Decision Boundaries** for signal detection in optical receivers.

## Engineering Focus:
Understanding the physical constraints of optical fiber communication through numerical simulations and statistical analysis.

## Technical Stack:
* **Python** (NumPy, SciPy for statistical functions).
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib for plotting signal constellations and noise distributions.
